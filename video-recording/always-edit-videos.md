# Always edit your videos

Always post-process your videos.

For lecture videos, get rid of mistakes, "umm"s, and other annoyances. If you said the wrong word, you can try to insert audio into the video, or you can create a callout on the screen that has the right word on it. Sometimes you will need a callout to highlight something that you realize was not obvious when you are listening to the video critically.

For coding (walkthruough) videos, the editing is lighter but it's still there. One thing that I sometimes do with coding videos is zoom into the text editor portion of the IDE when I'm writing the code, and zoom out again when I'm doing something that requires the student to see the entire IDE.
