# For video lectures, use headshots instead of picture-in-picture

If you are creating a lecture video with slides, for example, don't put a picture of yourself talking in the corner of the slide. It takes the students concentration from the material on the screen and makes it harder to edit things out.

If you want to make a point and think it would help the student to see you talking, use a short headshot instead. For example, show a slide or animation while you speak over it, describing what is happening, then cut to yourself commenting on it.
