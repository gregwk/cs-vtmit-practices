# Donâ€™t record your classroom lectures

Face-to-face classroom lectures are meant to last the duration of the class and be at least somewhat interactive. If you are teaching a live (synchronous) class twice a week with some students in front of you and some students listening remotely, then there are AV rooms in Virginia Tech that will help you do that. But MIT courses are asynchronous and students who are also working professionals will appreciate information that is delivered precisely and succinctly.

A good site to get ideas from is LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com). In general, the videos are clear, well-produced, and typically fairly short. Most of us have seen enough educational videos by now that we have an idea of what we like and what we don't. Find a presentation style that fits you. It does not have to be as polished as something on LinkedIn Learning, but it should be engaging and emphasize what you want students to take away from the readings and the assignments they may be doing during for that week's module.

Here are some suggestions for creating good lecture videos:

* Have a welcome video at the beginning of the course
* Write a script for each lecure video you produce (make it available on request)
* If you have slides, keep them simple and use diagrams when possible
* Make a portion of the video interactive
  * have a short quiz if your software allows it
  * ask the student to pause the video and think about a certain problem
* Edit out mistakes or annoying "ums" in post-production
