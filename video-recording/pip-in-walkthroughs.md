# For code walkthrough videos, PIP is fine

I like to make a distinction between lecture videos and (code) walkthrough videos.

Lecture videos shoud be carefully scripted, relatively brief, and they should get to the point quickly. They should have a relatively high production value in that you should go through the video afterwards with good editing software and delete any mistakes or distracting portions.

When I create a code walkthrough video, I just record the screen with the IDE I am using to edit the code. If I make a really big mistake, I might stop and start over, but if it's a smaller mistake, I will just leave it. If I make a coding error and end up fixing it later, I consider it a learning opportunity for the students watching. Even with these videos I will do some light post-processing, like getting rid of coughs or extended "umm"s. For walkthroughs I typically *do* put a webcam picture of myself in the corner so that students can see when I am confused.

**If you mess up when creating a video, keep recording.** Just go back to the start of the sentance or paragraph and do it over. Then when you are editing the video, just cut out the part you messed up and no one will be able to tell.
