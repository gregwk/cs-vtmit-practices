# Use a good-quality microphone

Many folks who make videos will tell you this, and it's true - good-quality audio is more important than good-quality video when you are watching a video. Try watching a YouTube video whose sound is muffled or echoey and you will see what they mean. A low resolution video with good audio is usually still watchable.

If you are recording your screen, the video will be fine. When you are talking into your mic, your voice might sound good to you, but the audio settings might be off when you play it back.

To make sure your audio is good:

* get a good-quality microphone (Blue Yeti or equivalent should is fine)
* do a sound test before you start your video
* listen to your video all the way through before you post it
