# Know what the MEng Degree is

The MEng degree is a 30-credit coursework-only degree. It was started in part because the CS department needs to aggressively grow its Master degree program in conjunction with the Innovation Campus that is being built in Northern Virginia - not far from where Amazon's HQ2 will be located.

MENG students will be able to take all MIT courses with the exception of CS5044 (Object-Oriented Programming with Java) and have them count towards their degree. CS5044 will not count because we expect MEng students to have the equivalent of CS5044 before they are accepted to the program.
