# Know what kinds of students the MIT Program has

Because the MIT program is a collaboration between business and CS/engineering, we get a wide variety of students in CS courses. This is one of the reasons we mandate CS5044 (Object-Oriented Programming with Java) as a gateway course (base requirement) for all other CS courses. Technically, we expect students to have some computer programming experience even before they take CS5044. Even after students have taken CS5044, there is still a significant variation between those who are comfortable with programming and those who are not. One of the benefits of Piazza - the online Q&A discussion site - is that it allows students to *answer* questions that other students ask, and you as an instructor have the ability to endorse those answers.

Many MIT students work full-time and tend to be older than the average Master's student. Therefore, they tend to be more mature, more experienced (professionally), and they also tend to have less time. When designing an MIT course, please take this into consideration. You can give challenging assignments, but try not to give a lot of busy work. For example, consider if two medium-difficulty problems can illustrate your point as well as five easier problems.

MIT students come from all over the country. Over half of MIT students are non-Virginia residents. We do not have significant numbers of international students. If a student resides in another country, they may be in the military.
