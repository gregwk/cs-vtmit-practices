# Know what kinds of students the MEng degree has

Because of our ambitious goals for increasing the number of Master students we graduate, the MEng degree is designed to appeal to as many potential students as possible. We are hoping it will be appealing to international students who want to complete a CS Master degree at an accelerated pace; and that it will also be appealing to working professionals who want to take evening courses and online courses while still working a full-time job.

MEng students accepted to the program will have had the equivalent of CS1 and CS2-level courses. They will be required to take three courses: (1) a course on ethics in CS, (2) a  data-structures/algorithms course, and (3) a capstone project course. None of these are MIT courses but we do plan to make the data-structures/algorithms course an MIT course eventually.
