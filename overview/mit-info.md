# Know what the MIT Program is

The Master's of Information Technology program is a 100% asynchronous online program that offers graduate-level courses in business, ECE, and computer science.

It has been around since 2002, and it officially made the change from synchronous to asynchronous in 2015.

From the [VT MIT web site](https://vtmit.vt.edu/academics/plan-your-study.html):

> To earn a Master of Information Technology degree at Virginia Tech, students must complete 11 courses — four core (foundation) courses and seven elective courses — for a total of 33 credit hours.  By choosing the appropriate courses, master's students can also earn a graduate certificate in one of six IT specialities as part of their degree program.

The program serves a wide variety of students, but is geared toward working professionals who want to get their Master's degree while they continue to work full-time. Because the program offers both business and technical courses, the variance in student comfort-level with a particular topic is significantly greater than a typical graduate course. You may have students who are experienced in web development in the same course as students who struggle with using basic data structures. **Most MIT students - even those involved in software development - do not even have the equivalent of a computer science minor.** MIT students tend to have less time to spend on projects, but they also tend to be more mature and better at managing their time.
