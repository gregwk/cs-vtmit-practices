# Know what the MIT Program is

The Master's of Information Technology program is a 100% asynchronous online program that offers graduate-level courses in business, ECE, and computer science. It's been around since 2002, and it officially made the change from synchronous to asynchronous in 2015.

Students have to take 4 core courses and 7 elective courses to complete a degree. All of the courses are 3 credits each, so thats 33 credits in all. The core courses are:

- ACIS 5504 Information Systems Design & Database Concepts
- BIT 5594 Web-Based Applications & Electronic Commerce
- MGT 5804 Strategic Leadership in Technology-Based Organizations
- CS 5044 Object-Oriented Programming with Java
- CS 5704 Software Engineering
- ECE 5484 Fundamentals of Computer Systems

There are 3 business-related core courses and 3 technical-related cores. Most MIT students have either a business or technical background, which means they will have to take at least one course out of their comfort zone.
