# Introduction
This document provides computer science instructors in Virginia Tech's online Master's of Information Technology program with a set of practices that have been found to work for others in the program. The Master's of Information Technology program is a 100% asynchronous online program that offers graduate-level courses in business, ECE, and computer science. The program serves a wide variety of students, but is geared toward working professionals who want to get their Master's degree while they continue to work full-time. Because the program offers both business and technical courses, the variance in student comfort-level with a particular topic is significantly greater than a typical graduate course. You may have students who are experienced in web development in the same course as students who struggle with using basic data structures. MIT students tend to have less time to spend on projects, but they also tend to be more mature and better at managing their time.
